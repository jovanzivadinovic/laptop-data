# Data Science and Machine Learning Tasks for `laptop_price.csv`

## 1. Exploratory Data Analysis - Done
- **Task:** Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the dataset. Identify patterns in laptop prices, distributions of features like brand, processor type, RAM size, and screen resolution. Visualize the relationships between different features and price.
- **Objective:** Gain insights into key factors influencing laptop prices.

## 2. Data Cleaning - Done (add other functions if needed)
- **Task:** Clean the dataset by addressing missing or inconsistent values. For example, standardize the format for screen size, processor type, and storage capacity if needed. Remove or impute missing values.
- **Objective:** Ensure the dataset is consistent and ready for analysis.

## 3. Feature Engineering - Done
- **Task:** Create new features from existing ones, such as:
  - **Performance-to-price ratio**: Combine processor speed, RAM, and GPU specs.
  - **Storage Type Indicator**: Separate SSD and HDD storage from mixed storage.
- **Objective:** Enhance the dataset with more meaningful features for analysis.

## 4. Price Prediction (Regression) - Done
- **Task:** Build a regression model to predict laptop prices based on features like RAM, processor type, GPU, and storage. Use algorithms like Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting, and compare their performances.
- **Evaluation Metric:** RMSE, MAE.
- **Objective:** Develop a model to predict laptop prices accurately.

## 5. Laptop Classification (Classification) - Done
- **Task:** Categorize laptops into price brackets (e.g., Low, Medium, High) based on price ranges. Use features like brand, specifications, and screen size to predict the category.
- **Evaluation Metric:** Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score.
- **Objective:** Build a classification model to identify the price range of laptops.

## 6. Clustering - Not Done
- **Task:** Group laptops into clusters based on their specifications (e.g., screen size, processor type, RAM, and GPU). Use clustering algorithms like K-Means and visualize the clusters.
- **Objective:** Discover hidden patterns in the dataset to group laptops by similarity.

## 7. Brand Analysis - Not Done
- **Task:** Analyze the average price, performance specs, and other key features for each brand. Identify the brands offering the best value for money.
- **Objective:** Provide actionable insights into brand pricing and feature differences.

## 8. Feature Importance Analysis - Not Done
- **Task:** Train a machine learning model (e.g., Random Forest) to predict laptop prices and use feature importance methods (e.g., SHAP values) to determine the most important factors affecting price.
- **Objective:** Identify key drivers of laptop prices.

## 9. Price Trend Analysis - Not Done
- **Task:** Analyze how laptop prices vary based on specific features such as:
  - Processor type (Intel vs AMD)
  - GPU type (Integrated vs Dedicated)
  - RAM size
- **Objective:** Identify trends in pricing for different configurations.

## 10. Recommendation System - Not Done
- **Task:** Build a recommendation system to suggest laptops based on user preferences (e.g., budget, gaming vs work use, portability). Use similarity measures to find laptops with similar specifications.
- **Objective:** Develop a system to assist users in selecting the most suitable laptop.
